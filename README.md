Explanation

    Preprocessing: The sentence_to_graph function converts a sentence into a graph where each node represents a word, and edges connect consecutive words. Each node feature indicates whether the word contains digits.
    Graph Data Conversion: The graph_to_data function extracts node features and the adjacency matrix from the graph.
    Autoencoder Design: The GraphAutoencoder class defines an autoencoder model with an encoder, latent space, and decoder.
    Training: The autoencoder is trained to reconstruct the node features from the graph.
    Feature Extraction: The extract_features function uses the encoder part of the trained autoencoder to extract the compressed features from the graph.
